# KVLab

Experimental laboratory for KV-state representation, manipulation, transfer and causal analysis.

The 223-byte README was lying by omission. The lab already has a Python package (`kvlab/`), tests, and preregistered KV studies. Do not start a second KV repository.

## What this repository is

- Execution surface for campaigns C1–C11 / C6 as preregistered in `docs/`
- Causal analysis of KV-cache mechanics used by FLAT / TurboQuant / ADA
- Scientific source of truth for the first-class **Boolean KV Cache** programme
- Evidence packs belong here, not in a new lab

## What this repository is not

- Not the FLAT kernel owner (`Memorithm/FLAT-ATTENTION`)
- Not the TurboQuant codec owner (`Memorithm/TurboQuant`)
- Not a training run farm
- Not a place to silently change a preregistration after seeing results

### Boolean KV Cache

KVLab now distinguishes three architectures that must never be conflated:

1. **NKV** — numerical KV baseline;
2. **BIKV** — Boolean-indexed numerical KV, where Boolean state selects pages/blocks but exact numerical K/V remains authoritative;
3. **NBKV** — native Boolean KV for explicitly Boolean operations, research-only until separately qualified.

The dedicated roadmap covers packed Boolean page indexes, CPU/SIMD/multicore execution, dual-socket NUMA experiments, large-RAM qualification, portable GPU search, CPU+GPU cooperative execution, first-token readiness, and composition with the existing KVLab programme.

The first dedicated large-memory target is the verified Dell T430 host captured in the BKV evidence pack: 2 × Intel Xeon E5-2683 v4, each with 16 physical cores / 32 SMT threads, for 32 physical cores / 64 logical CPUs total, two NUMA nodes and approximately 125.8 GiB system RAM. Every run must continue to detect and record the exact CPU SKU, physical/logical core count, NUMA topology, cache hierarchy and available instruction set rather than infer them from the chassis name.

#### Current T430 qualification status

BKV-K4 has now qualified a **distinct socket-local shard** layout for the frozen 32,000,000-page × 256-bit T430 campaign at exact evaluated commit `7e02edc1e3ac3b53cfb352cfad560db439755a0f`. Two 16,000,000-page shards, each scanned by 16 physical workers on its local socket, produced exactly the same 2,283 global candidate page IDs as the 32-physical-core interleaved monolithic oracle. The measured median pair latency was 12.133153 ms versus 15.111998 ms for the monolithic comparator, i.e. 1.245513× for this frozen host/workload. The reported 84.396859 GB/s is derived logical packed-signature throughput, not a direct DRAM-bandwidth measurement. This result is host/workload-specific and does not establish an end-to-end attention speedup.

The next Boolean-KV gate is BKV-K5 / BIKV: preserve page identity and generation while handing Boolean-selected pages to authoritative numerical K/V, then measure Boolean overhead, numerical K/V bytes avoided, first-token/TPOT and downstream correctness before any runtime promotion.

## Canon

See `Memorithm/scirust-hub` `CATALOG.md` and ADR-0020. Existing preregistrations remain authoritative for their campaigns. New Boolean KV experiments must be preregistered under the dedicated roadmap before confirmatory runs; the new programme extends KVLab rather than redesigning or duplicating it.
